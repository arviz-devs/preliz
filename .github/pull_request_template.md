## Description
<!--
Thank you so much for your PR! To help us review your contribution, please consider the following points:

- The PR title should summarize the changes, for example "Add new group argument for the pair plot".
  Avoid non-descriptive titles such as "Addresses issue #348".

- The description should provide at least 1-2 sentences describing the pull request in detail and
  link to any relevant issues.

- Please prefix the title of incomplete contributions with [WIP] (to indicate a work in
  progress). WIPs may be useful to (1) indicate you are working on something to avoid
  duplicated work, (2) request broad review of functionality or API, or (3) seek collaborators. -->
