    Prior Predictive Elicitation.

    This method is experimental and under development. It does not offers guarantees of
    correctness. Use with caution and triple-check the results.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : a probabilistic model
        Currently it only works with PyMC model. More PPls coming soon.
    method : str
        Method used to generate samples that match the target distribution.
        Defaults to `"projective"`, another option is `"pathfinder"`.
        If `"projective"`, the parameters of the priors are only used to provide an initial
        guess for the optimization routine. Thus their effect on the result is smaller than in
        traditional Bayesian inference, unless the priors are very vague or very strong.
        If `"projective"`, the observed values are ignored, but not their size.
        Pathfinder is a variational inference method so the role of the priors and observed values
        is what is expected in Bayesian inference.
    engine : str
        Library used to define the model. Either `"auto"` (default), `"pymc"` or `"bambi"`.
        Ig `"auto"`, the library is automatically detected.
    target : a PreliZ distribution or list
        Instance of a PreliZ distribution or a list of tuples where each tuple contains a PreliZ
        distribution and a weight.
        This represents the prior predictive distribution **previously** elicited by the user,
        possibly using other PreliZ's methods to obtain this distribution, such as maxent,
        roulette, quartile, etc.
        This should represent the domain-knowledge of the user and not any observed dataset.
    random_state : {None, int, numpy.random.Generator, numpy.random.RandomState}
        Defaults to 0. Ignored if `method` is `"pathfinder"`.

    Returns
    -------
    new_priors : str
        A string representation of the new priors. The user can copy and paste it into
        the model's code. Ideally, with none to minimal changes.
