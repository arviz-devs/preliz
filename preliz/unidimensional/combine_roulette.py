def combine_roulette(responses, weights=None, dist_names=None, params=None):
    """
    Combine multiple elicited distributions into a single distribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    responses : list of tuples
        Typically, each tuple comes from the ``.inputs`` attribute of a ``Roulette`` object and
        represents a single elicited distribution.
    weights : array-like, optional
        Weights for each elicited distribution. Defaults to None, i.e. equal weights.
        The sum of the weights must be equal to 1, otherwise it will be normalized.
    dist_names: list
        List of distributions names to be used in the elicitation.
        Defaults to ["Normal", "BetaScaled", "Gamma", "LogNormal", "StudentT"].
    params : str, optional
        Extra parameters to be passed to the distributions. The format is a string with the
        PreliZ's distribution name followed by the argument to fix.
        For example: "TruncatedNormal(lower=0), StudentT(nu=8)".

    Returns
    -------
    PreliZ distribution
