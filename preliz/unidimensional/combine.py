    """
    Combine a set of distributions into a single one.

    Fit a weighted sample from ``distributions`` into the distributions listed in ``dist_names`.
    The fit is done using maximum likelihood estimation, and the best match is plotted.
    Notice that the result is NOT a Mixture distribution, but a single distribution
    that best fits the weighted sample.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distributions : List of PreliZ distributions
        These are the distributions that we want to combine. Typically, these have been
        elicited from different individuals or instances.
    weights : array-like, optional
        Weights for each distribution. Defaults to None, i.e. equal weights.
        The sum of the weights must be equal to 1, otherwise it will be normalized.
    dist_names: list
        List of distributions to fit the weighted sample.
        Defaults to ``["Normal", "Gamma", "LogNormal", "StudentT"]``.
    sample_size : int
        Number of total samples to generate for the fit.
    rng : int or numpy.random.Generator, optional
        Random number generator or seed. Defaults to ``0``.
    plot : int
        Number of distributions to plots. Defaults to ``1`` (i.e. plot the best match)
        If larger than the number of passed distributions it will plot all of them.
        Use ``0`` or ``False`` to disable plotting.
    plot_kwargs : dict
        Dictionary passed to the method ``plot_pdf()``.
    ax : matplotlib axes

    Returns
    -------
    fitted_distributions : list of PreliZ distributions.
        The distributions that best fit the weighted sample. Sorted from best to worst match.
    axes : matplotlib axes
