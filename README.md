# PreliZ
Tools to help you pick a prior.


**This package is very new and all of its features are experimental, not yet well tested, and subject to change without notice.**

## The Zen of PreliZ

* Being open source. 
* Avoid automated solutions.
* Separate tasks among humans and computers.
* Prevent overconfidence on users opinions.
* Easily integrate with other tools.
* Allow to perform prior predictive checks.
* Having a simple and intuitive interface suitable for non-specialists in order to minimize cognitive biases and heuristics.
* Switching between different types of visualization such as kernel density estimates plots, quantile dotplots, histograms, etc. 
* Being agnostic of the underlying programming language, or at least interoperable with as many languages as possible.
* Working on top of open source libraries related to Bayesian workflow and uncertainty visualization (ggdist, Bayesplot, ArviZ).
* Modularity.
