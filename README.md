## The Zen of PreliZ
* Being open source, community-driven, diverse and inclusive.
* Avoid fully-automated solutions, keep the human in the loop.
* Separate tasks between humans and computers, so users can retain control of important decisions while numerically demanding, error-prone or tedious tasks are automatized.
* Prevent users to become overconfident in their own opinions.
* Easily integrate with other tools.
* Allow predictive elicitation.
* Having a simple and intuitive interface suitable for non-specialists in order to minimize cognitive biases and heuristics.
* Switching between different types of visualization such as kernel density estimates plots, quantile dotplots, histograms, etc. 
* Being agnostic of the underlying probabilistic programming language.
* Being modular.
