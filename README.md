# PreliZ
Tools to help you pick a prior.


**This package is very new and all of its features are experimental, not yet well tested, and subject to change without notice.**

## The Zen of PreliZ
* Being open source. 
* Avoid fully-automated solutions, keep the human in the loop
* Separate tasks between humans and computers, so users can retain control of important decisions while numerically demanding, error-prone or tedious tasks are automatized.
* Prevent users to become overconfidence in their own opinions.
* Easily integrate with other tools.
* Allow predictive elicitation
* Having a simple and intuitive interface suitable for non-specialists in order to minimize cognitive biases and heuristics.
* Switching between different types of visualization such as kernel density estimates plots, quantile dotplots, histograms, etc. 
* Being agnostic of the underlying probabilistic programming language
* Being modular
