================

The examples in this section showcase the flexibility and capabilities of PreliZ for working with distributions and eliciting probability distributions. Some methods are more automatic than others but some level of interactivity and visual inspection is expected as you should be the final judge.

Distribution Guide and Settings
-------------------------------

This section is where youâ€™ll learn how to define, manipulate, and visualize distributions directly.

Direct Elicitation

Direct Elicitation demonstrates how to interactively elicit a probability distribution.

Predictive Elicitation
----------------------

This section illustrates how PreliZ can be used to perform elicitation on the observed space, instead of the parameters space like in the previous examples. In all these example the prior predictive distribution is key.
