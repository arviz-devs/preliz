# Mixture Distribution

This is not a distribution per se, but a modifier of univariate distributions.

A mixture distribution is a probability distribution that results from the combination of two or more univariate distributions. The resulting distribution is a weighted sum of the component distributions. 

Mixture distributions are widely used whenever a single, simple distribution cannot adequately capture the complexity of a dataset. For example, in modeling the distribution of incomes across a population with distinct socioeconomic groups, mixtures can represent each subgroupâ€™s unique income pattern. 

## Key properties and parameters

**Parameters:**

- `dists` : (list of Univariate PreliZ distributions) Components of the mixture. They should be all discrete or all continuous.
- `weights` : (list of floats) List of weights for each distribution. Weights must be larger or equal to 0 and their sum must be positive. If the weights do not sum up to 1, they will be normalized.

### Probability Density Function (PDF)

Given a list of base distributions with cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) and probability density/mass functions (PDFs/PMFs). The pdf of a Mixture distribution is:

$$
f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \, w_i \, p_i(x)
$$

where $w_i$ is the weight of the $i$-th distribution and $p_i(x)$ is the PDF/PMF of the $i$-th distribution.

from preliz import Normal, Mixture, style

Mixture([Normal(0, 0.5), Normal(2, 0.5)], [0.2, 0.8]).plot_pdf()
Normal(0, 0.5).plot_pdf(alpha=0.5)
Normal(2, 0.5).plot_pdf(alpha=0.5);
```

### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a Mixture distribution is the sum of the CDFs of the component distributions.

$$
F(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \, w_i \, P_i(x)
$$

where $w_i$ is the weight of the $i$-th distribution and $P_i(x)$ is the CDF of the $i$-th distribution.
