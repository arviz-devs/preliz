# Poisson Distribution

<audio controls> <source src="../../_static/poisson.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> This browser cannot play the pronunciation audio file for this distribution. </audio>

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time (or space) if these events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.

**Probability Density Function (PDF):**

$$
f(x \mid \mu) = \frac{e^{-\mu}\mu^x}{x!}
$$

**Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):**

$$
F(x \mid \mu) = \frac{\Gamma(x + 1, \mu)}{x!}
$$

where $\Gamma(x + 1, \mu)$ is the [upper incomplete gamma function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_gamma_function).

**Common Alternatives:**

- [NegativeBinomial](negative_binomial.md) - The Negative Binomial is often used as an alternative the Poisson when the variance is greater than the mean (overdispersed data).
- [ZeroInflatedPoisson](zero_inflated_poisson.md) - The Zero-Inflated Poisson is used when there is an excess of zero counts in the data.
- [HurdlePoisson](hurdle.md) - The Hurdle Poisson is used when there is an excess of zero counts in the data.

**Related Distributions:**

- [Binomial](binomial.md) - The Poisson distribution can be derived as a limiting case to the binomial distribution as the number of trials goes to infinity and the expected number of successes remains fixed. See [law of rare events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution#law_of_rare_events). 
- [Normal](normal.md) - For sufficiently large values of $\mu$, the normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation \sqrt{\mu} can be a good approximation to the Poisson.
