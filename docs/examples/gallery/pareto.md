# Pareto Distribution

The Pareto distribution is a continuous probability distribution that was introduced by the Italian scientist Vilfredo Pareto (1848â€“1923). It is a power-law probability distribution that is characterized by a heavy right tail. It is defined by two parameters: the scale parameter $m$ and the shape parameter $\alpha$.

It was originally used to describe the distribution of wealth in society where a small proportion of the population holds a large proportion of the wealth (the "80-20 rule"). It has since been used in various fields to describe a wide range of phenomena where events get rarer at greater magnitudes.

In Bayesian modeling, it plays a key role in Pareto Smoothed Importance Sampling (PSIS) for stabilizing importance weights. PSIS is used in model evaluation methods like PSIS-LOO (Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation) where LOO applies a smoothing procedure that uses values from an estimated Pareto distribution to replace the largest importance weights, making LOO more robust. Moreover, the estimated $\hat{k}$ parameter of the Pareto distribution can be used as a  diagnostic tool to assess the reliability of the importance weights.

Support   :math:`x \in [m, \infty)`
Mean      :math:`\frac{\alpha m}{\alpha - 1}` for :math:`\alpha > 1`
Variance  :math:`\frac{m^2 \alpha}{(\alpha - 1)^2 (\alpha - 2)}` for :math:`\alpha > 2`

f(x|\alpha, m) = \frac{\alpha m^\alpha}{x^{\alpha + 1}}

**Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):**

$$
F(x|\alpha, m) = 1 - \left(\frac{m}{x}\right)^\alpha

**Related Distributions:**

- [Exponential Distribution](exponential.md) - If X is Pareto distributed, with scale parameter $m$, and shape parameter $\alpha$, then $Y = log(X/m)$ is exponentially distributed with rate parameter $\lambda = \alpha$.
- [Log-Normal Distribution](log_normal.md) - Also used for modeling positive, skewed data with long tails. The log-normal distribution allows for more flexibility in shaping the tail behavior compared to the Pareto distribution.
