Overview
========

Prior elicitation refers to the process of transforming the knowledge of a particular domain into well-defined probability distributions.
Specifying useful priors is a central aspect of Bayesian statistics. PreliZ is a Python package aimed at helping practitioners choose prior
distributions by offering a set of tools for the various facets of prior elicitation. It covers a range of methods, from unidimensional prior
elicitation on the parameter space to predictive elicitation on the observed space. The goal is to be compatible with probabilistic programming
languages (PPL) in the Python ecosystem like PyMC and PyStan, while remaining agnostic of any specific PPL.


Dependencies
============
PreliZ is tested on Python 3.8+.

Installation
