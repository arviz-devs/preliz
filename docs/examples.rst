Examples
========

The examples in this section showcase the flexibility and capabilities of PreliZ for working with distributions and eliciting probability distributions.
Some methods are more automatic than others but some level of interactivity and visual inspection is expected as you should be the final judge.

In **Working with Distributions**, youâ€™ll learn how to define, manipulate, and visualize distributions directly. **Direct Elicitation in 1D** demonstrates how 
to interactively elicit a one-dimensional probability distribution. Extending this to higher dimensions, **Direct Elicitation in ND** highlights methods for
exploring and eliciting distributions in multi-dimensional spaces.

The **Predictive Elicitation** section illustrates how PreliZ can be used to perform elicitation on the observed space, instead of the parameters
space like in the previous examples. In all these example the prior predictive distribution is key.
